<p>Some text</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_theory" title="Literary theory">literary theory</a>, a&nbsp;<strong>text</strong>&nbsp;is any object that can be &quot;read&quot;, whether this object is a work of literature, a street sign, an arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of clothing. It is a coherent set of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics)" title="Sign (semiotics)">signs</a>&nbsp;that transmits some kind of informative&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message" title="Message">message</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_(literary_theory)#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;This set of signs is considered in terms of the informative message&#39;s&nbsp;<em>content</em>, rather than in terms of its physical form or the medium in which it is represented.</p>

<p>Within the field of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_criticism" title="Literary criticism">literary criticism</a>, &quot;text&quot; also refers to the original information content of a particular piece of writing; that is, the &quot;text&quot; of a work is that primal symbolic arrangement of letters as originally composed, apart from later alterations, deterioration, commentary, translations,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratext" title="Paratext">paratext</a>, etc. Therefore, when literary criticism is concerned with the determination of a &quot;text&quot;, it is concerned with the distinguishing of the original information content from whatever has been added to or subtracted from that content as it appears in a given textual document (that is, a physical representation of text).</p>

<p>Since the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_writing" title="History of writing">history of writing</a>&nbsp;predates the concept of the &quot;text&quot;, most texts were not written with this concept in mind. Most written works fall within a narrow range of the types described by text theory. The concept of &quot;text&quot; becomes relevant if and when a &quot;coherent written message is completed and needs to be referred to independently of the circumstances in which it was created.&quot;</p>
